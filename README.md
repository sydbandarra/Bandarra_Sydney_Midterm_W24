This is a GitHub Repository for MMED-1056 Web Development 1 - Midterm - Responsive Web Layout - Deliverable 2

## MMED-1055 Mulitmedia Authoring 2 - HW #2 - Assignment Brief

The midterm deliverables require you to plan and prepare wireframes and responsive boxed Web layouts to demonstrate your ability to create a wireframe and then translate it into a responsive grid layout.

Each student is required to complete these midterm steps individually. The wireframes should be for a Web site of your own design (not your FIP as those wireframes are done in your design classes), and then you are required to create a boxed responsive layout (no specific content)

You can use the boxed layout you create for this midterm for your FIP if you wish, or you can create a new boxed layout.

You will have time in class over 2 weeks to work on the different deliverables/stages, which are as follows:

**Step 1:** Wireframes for 2 HTML pages
Submit WIP wireframes, PDF only (5%)

**Step 2:** Boxed responsive layout for 1 page (index.html)
Completed wireframes from Step 1, and boxed-out HTML page (15%)
